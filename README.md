# Character-Range-Checker-in-JavaScript
This code snippet presents two implementations of a function in JavaScript, func1, designed to check if the second character of a string falls within a specific range.The first implementation, commented out, has syntax issues and does not function properly. The second implementation uses the charAt() method to properly assess if the character is within the specified range. An example usage with the string "briem" is provided at the end.
